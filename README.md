# MPI-Based-Parallel-Computing-for-Prime-Number-Gerneration
 Enhanced a C-programmed, MPI-based parallel. Implemented block decomposition techniques to improve data retrieval and cache hit rates, coupled with reducing communication overhead and adopting synchronous computation on multi-core systems. Conducted benchmark tests on a high-performance computing cluster with various MPI core configurations.
