# MPI-Based-Parallel-Computing-for-Prime-Number-Gerneration
Enhanced a C-programmed, MPI-based parallel. Implemented block decomposition techniques to improve data retrieval and cache hit rates, coupled with reducing communication overhead and adopting synchronous computation on multi-core systems. Conducted benchmark tests on a high-performance computing cluster with various MPI core configurations. The improvement resulted in a significant reduction time from 17.73 seconds to 0.11 seconds

Our sourse code is coming soon.
